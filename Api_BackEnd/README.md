# Git' It: Back End

## Background

The back-end of this application was really a teaching moment for me with regards
to how Javascript handles OOP. 

Preliminary iterations were simply using AJAX
requests to grab the information and display it procedurally. 
However, since this was also an exercise in making a 
somewhat complete Proof of Concept, I later decided
to start saving that data in a more Object Oriented way.
Those familiar with Github will notice the structure immediately,
but just for completeness' sake:

##### Organization
##### Repository
##### Commit
##### File
